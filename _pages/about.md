Hello, thanks for taking a look! I am a Researcher in the [CLEAN unit](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University, where I study the economics of law and crime. In addition to being a Researcher at [CLEAN](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/people/researchers/zachary-porreca), I am a [SSRC-Arnold Ventures Criminal Justice Innovation Fellow](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/arnold-ventures-criminal-justice-innovation-fellowships/fellows/), a Fellow of the [Global Labor Organization (GLO)](https://glabor.org/user/zachporreca/), an Associated Researcher with [Centro Ricerche Economiche Nord Sud (CRENoS)](https://crenos.unica.it/crenos/people/zachary-porreca) and a Fellow of the [Institute for European Policymaking at Bocconi University (IEP@BU)](https://iep.unibocconi.eu/people/zachary-porreca?_gl=1*eqlw98*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTI1OTgxNzkzLjE3MjA3MzA1NTk.*_ga_YD6KN3P4TH*MTcyMDczMDU1OC4xLjEuMTcyMDczMDU2Ni4wLjAuMA..). I completed my [PhD in Economics](https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.12004) at West Virginia University in Spring 2023. I'm primarily interested in the ways people interact with one another outside of formal institutions. Prior to joing WVU's Economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department there, working on research related to fishery production. I do hope to do a bit more work in that area in the future. My undergrad was completed amdist COVID in 2020 through Pell Grant funding at Bloomsburg University in Central Pennsylvania. In my free time I like to travel and spend time outdoors.
