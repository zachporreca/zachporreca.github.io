I am a Researcher in the [CLEAN unit](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/) at Bocconi University, where I study the economics of law and crime, and am a [SSRC-Arnold Ventures Criminal Justice Innovation Fellow](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/arnold-ventures-criminal-justice-innovation-fellowships/fellows/). I completed my [PhD in Economics](https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.12004) at West Virginia University in Spring 2023 under the supervision and mentorship of [Bryan McCannon](https://sites.google.com/site/bryancmccannon). I'm primarily interested in the ways people interact with one another outside of formal institutions. Prior to joing WVU's Economics department, I spent a year in the Natural Resource Economics department there, working on research related to fishery production. I do hope to do a bit more work in that area in the future. My undergrad was completed amdist COVID in 2020 through Pell Grant funding at [Bloomsburg University](https://www.commonwealthu.edu/academics/programs/economics-ba) in Central Pennsylvania. In my free time I like to travel and spend time outdoors.
